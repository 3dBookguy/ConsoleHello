# ConsoleHello

The initial commit had no README.md so now I add this here in the local C:\Users\pstan\source\repos\ConsoleHello and see if I can push it to github https://github.com/3dBookguy/ConsoleHello.  First directly using git locally.

pstan@LAPTOP-9U3MJ47K MINGW64 ~/source/repos/ConsoleHello (master)
$ git add README.md

pstan@LAPTOP-9U3MJ47K MINGW64 ~/source/repos/ConsoleHello (master)
$ git status
